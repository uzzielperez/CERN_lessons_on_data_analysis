# What is Bash? 

- ### Bash = **Bourne Again shell**

- ### **TL;DR:** Bash is a shell program designed to listen to my commands and do what I tell it to. - [The Bash Academy](https://guide.bash.academy/)

- ### Other Shell Programs: _zsh_, _csh_, _ksh_... 
- ### On macOS/Linux open terminal and you have a bash shell. 
- ### On Windows install **Windows Subsystem for Linux** (WSL)

```bash
wsl --install
```

# What is Lxplus?

- ### _*lxplus*_ is CERN's interactive linux service for all users 
- It is provided by the IT department and you need to request the activation of "AFS Workspaces" and of 
lxplus and linux for your account through the [CERN Resource Portal](https://resources.web.cern.:x
ch/resources/Manage/ListServices.aspx)
- Also extremely helpful to get some `eos/CERNBox` storage as well

#  Checking the manual 

Open the terminal and let's get right on to it! 

First command to learn: 

```bash
man bash
```

This shows the documentation on Bash including all the options that can be used with this command.
## SSH: Connecting to a remote computer 

```bash
man ssh
```

**SSH** or Secure Shell is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer or server over an unsecured network.

NAME
       bash - GNU Bourne-Again SHell

SYNOPSIS
       bash [options] [command_string | file]

COPYRIGHT
       Bash is Copyright (C) 1989-2020 by the Free Software Foundation, Inc.

DESCRIPTION
       Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also incorporates use‚Äê
       ful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and csh).

       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE  Standard  1003.1).   Bash
       can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.

OPTIONS
       All  of  the  single-character  shell  options documented in the description of the set builtin command, including -o, can be used as options when the
       shell is invoked.  In addition, bash interprets the following options when it is invoked:

       -c        If the -c option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument command_string.  If there  are  arguments  after  the
                 command_string,  the first argument is assigned to $0 and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment
                 to $0 sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning and error messages.
       -i        If the -i option is present, the shell is interactive.
       -l        Make bash act as if it had been invoked as a login shell (see INVOCATION below).

#  SSH to LXPLUS


```bash
ssh -XY USERNAME@lxplus.cern.ch
```

You can read from 
```bash 
man ssh 
```

what the flags after ssh are for. 

```

```

- ## Accessing the Grid 

To access the grid, we need to initialize a valid **Grid Proxy Certificate** which is essential for accessing various LHCb and CERN computing resources (data storages, job submission and file transfer). 

```bash
lhcb-proxy-init 
```

This command is a wrapper around the standard `voms-proxy-init`. You should see a similar output as on the right.

::right:: 

```bash {*}{maxHeight:'450px', maxWidth:'50px'}
ciperez:~$ lhcb-proxy-init

#  File System navigation 

Commands to navigate the file system. If you are using `lxplus`, you are most-likely 
using the **AFS** or the _Andrew File System_ which is a distributed file system where multiple computers are allowed to share files and data efficiently.

#  Modifying files and directories 

Below are a list of commands to modify files and directories.

```bash {*}{maxHeight:'450px', maxWidth:'70px'}

| Command                     | Description                                         | Examples                   |

# Display and Redirection 


<!-- - ### Redirecting 
``` bash
echo "First line" > file.txt       # Creates/overwrites file
echo "Second line" >> file.txt     # Appends to file
``` -->


- ###  To display messages 
  
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, My name's Forrest."
  ```

- ### To create a file with Echo
  
  ```bash
  echo "Hello, My name's Forrest." > helloworld.txt
  ```

- ### To append to a file
    
    ```bash
    echo "Forrest Gump." >> helloworld.txt
    ```
- ### To display the content of the file
  ``` bash 
  cat helloworld
  ```
In general the right angle bracket tells the system to output results into a target. 


::right::

```bash
echo "  /\___/\ "
echo " (  o o  )"
echo " (  =^=  )"
echo "  --m-m-- "
```

To save the cat into a file:

```bash
echo -e " /\\___/\\\n(  o o  )\n(  =^=  )\n (--m-m--)" > cat.txt
```

Here's a dog:
```
echo -e "  ___________________
< Hello, nice to meet you! >
  -------------------
     \\   ^__^
      \\  (oo)\\_______
         (__)\\       )\\/\\

# Piping and Cat 

Like the Force, Piping flows through the terminal, connecting commands together. It's a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural. Let's use R2-D2 to help us organize some Imperial documents.

First, let's create 10 Death Star plans:
  ```bash
  touch deathstar-plans-{001..010}.txt

  .---.
      /    |\          
      |    | \         .-'''-.
      |    |  \       /   <0> \ 
      |    |   \     /  .---.  \    BEEPS: "Now piping data..."
      |    |    \   /  /     \  \
                 \ /  /       \  \
                  '  /         \  \
                  \  |         |  |
                   | |         |  |
                   |_|         |__|
  ```

  

::right::
Now, let's use R2-D2 to pipe these secret plans into a secure Rebel database file named 
```bash 
find . -name "deathstar-plans-*" > rebel_intel.txt
cat rebel_intel.txt

# Search plans for weakness references
cat rebel_intel.txt | grep "exhaust-port"

# Count total number of stolen plans
ls deathstar-plans* | wc -l

# Sort plans by security level and send to R2
cat rebel_intel.txt | sort | R2D2-encrypt
```
<!-- # Command Reference Table -->
```

| Command | Description                                    | 
| --------| -----------------------------------------------|
| cat     | Displays file content, concatenate files       |
| grep    | Search for patterns, filter matching lines     |
| wc      | Count words (w)/lines (l)/chars (c)            | 
| sort    | Sort lines of text (-r, reverse, -n, numeric)  |
```

#  More commands 

Below are a list of commands to modify files and directories.

```bash {*}{maxHeight:'450px', maxWidth:'70px'}

| Command                            | Description                           | Examples                              |
| -----------------------------------| --------------------------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| grep [pattern][file]               | Looks for a pattern in file           | grep "exhaust-port" rebel_intel.txt   |
| find [directory] -n[name]          | Finds a file in directory             | find . -n rebel_intel.txt             |
| sed "s/[find]/[replace]/g" [file]  | Find and replace a pattern in a text  | sed "s/Luke/Leia/g" rebel_intel.txt   |
| ln -s [filename] [symlinkname]     | Create a symlink                      | ln -s [rebel_intel.txt][rebel.txt]    |
| history                            |

```
 * `grep` is short for _global regular expression print_. It is a useful command to search for matching patterns in a file.
 * `sed` stands for _stream editor_ and it can be used to edit text files. It is commonly used to replace occurences of words in a file.  
 * Creating a symlink is neat way to create shortcut to the original file without having to copy the file.
 * To run the 100th command in history, one can do `!100`

The `tail` command is used to output the last part of files. By default, it outputs the last 10 lines of each file. You can also specify the number of lines to output.

```bash
  tail [filename]
```

You can also specify the number of lines to output:

```bash
  tail -n 5 [filename]
```

Let's make 100 Clone Troopers and print out the first 3 lines and the last 5 lines in the list.
```bash
echo "Creating Clone Army..." > clone_trooper.txt

Bash scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks on Linux and can be used in endless ways and boosts productivity and having basic knowledge of it is important if you‚Äôre planning on becoming an ethical hacker or system administrator or simply want to automate tedious boring tasks and we‚Äôll hopefully explore more in later blogs and build interesting tools with it - **moo**, some guy on [medium](https://medium.com/geekculture/bash-scripting-for-dummies-5d855cbada66)

# Bash Scripting Crash Course

Inspired by the [Missing Shell Scripting Crash Course](https://dev.to/godcrampy/the-missing-shell-scripting-crash-course-37mk)


- ## Variable 
Assigning value to a variable needs `$`, otherwise bash will treat name as a string literal and it will output `Hello name` instead.
```bash 
#!/bin/bash
name ="Luke Skywalker"
echo "Hello, $name"
```

To run,  
```bash
$user chmod
$user ./script.sh
```
::right::

- ## User input

```bash
read -p "What is you name: " name
echo "Hello $name"

read -p "Enter an action: " verb
echo "You are ${verb}ing"
```
- ## Arguments

`$1, $2..` store the arguments passed to the script... 

```bash
echo $0
echo $1
echo $2
echo "${@}" # Access all the arguments [More on this later]
```

So if you do `./script.sh condition1 condition2`, what happens? It just echos the strings passed on to the script.

# Bash Scripting Crash Course

Inspired by the [Missing Shell Scripting Crash Course](https://dev.to/godcrampy/the-missing-shell-scripting-crash-course-37mk)


- ## Logical Comparisons 

* [[]] enables to use operators. 
*  Comparisons: `=, !=, >, <, ‚â§, ‚â•`
* Leave some space on both ends of brackets.. :) 

```bash 
if [[ "$name" == "adam driver" ]]
then
   echo "hi adam we missed you"
else
   echo "welcome $name"
fi
```

::right::

- ## Test commands for some complex operations

```bash
[[ -e "$file" ]] # True if file exists
[[ -d "$file" ]] # True if file exists and is a directory
[[ -f "$file" ]] # True if file exists and is a regular file
[[ -z "$str" ]]  # True if string is of length zero
[[ -n "$str" ]]  # True is string is not of length zero

# Compare Strings
[[ "$str1" == "$str2" ]]
[[ "$str1" != "$str2" ]]

# Integer Comparisions
[[ "$int1" -eq "$int2" ]] # $int1 == $int2
[[ "$int1" -ne "$int2" ]] # $int1 != $int2
[[ "$int1" -gt "$int2" ]] # $int1 > $int2
[[ "$int1" -lt "$int2" ]] # $int1 < $int2
[[ "$int1" -ge "$int2" ]] # $int1 >= $int2
[[ "$int1" -le "$int2" ]] # $int1 <= $int2

# And or 
[[ ... ]] && [[ ... ]] # And
[[ ... ]] || [[ ... ]] # Or

echo "${arr[-1]}"    # Last element
echo "${arr[@]:1}"   # Elements from 1
echo "${arr[@]:1:3}" # Elements from 1 to 3
```

To insert: 
```bash 
arr[5]=e                            # direct address and insert/update
arr=(${arr[@]:0:1} new ${arr[@]:1}) # Adding 'new' to array
```

To delete:
```bash
arr=(a b c d)
unset arr[1]
echo << "${arr[1]}" # Outputs nothing
```

::right::

- ## Deleting needs re-indexing

```bash
arr=(a b c d)
unset arr[1]
arr=("${arr[@]}")
echo << "${arr[1]}" # c
```

# File to store the cat
cat_file="cat.txt"

# Draw a cat with eyes open and write to the file

```

::right::
Run the script. 

```bash
chmod +x cat_draw.sh
./cat_draw.sh
```

Check the contents of the `cat_file` with `cat cat_file`. 

Can you use your Jedi Tricks to make this cat sleep?
Use the `sed` command and store it into another `txt` file.

# Minimal Safe Bash Script Template Walkthrough

* FAIL FAST

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file
```
Suppose the backups directory does not exist. If there is no safety option `set -Eeuo pipefail`, bash jumps into the next command and deletes the important file before you can react.

* Get the Location
```bash
script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &>/dev/null && pwd -P)
```

Often we find the scripts we need to run in some other directory e.g. `/some/long/path/to/script.sh`. 
This can be fixed by going to the directory before execution with `cd /some/long/path/to/ && ./script.sh`

# Miscellaneous 

- ## TMUX, Screen
Lets you split session into windows and also lets you log out and having the session running. 
For big workloads, better to use HTCondor. Helps with monitoring CPU/memory usage too.

See a [Quick and Easy Guide to TMUX](https://hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/) and [How to Use Linux Screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/).

- ## LCG Stacks and Apptainer 

If you want an environment where everything works harmoniously, you might want to create a conda environment, or a python environment. 

It is however better to rely on the already installed software to work with the platform you currently have. 

```bash
env | grep -i platform
source /cvmfs/sft.cern.ch/lcg/views/setupViews.sh <LCG_number> <platform>
```

For ML related stuff, one can also get gpu-supported programs such as `tensorflow` with `LCG_106cuda for lxplus-gpu`.
To check the latest LCG releases [click here](https://lcginfo.cern.ch/).
